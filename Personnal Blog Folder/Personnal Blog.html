<h2> Educational Background </h2>
<br>

i graduated in <abbr title="Pateros National Highschool">PNHS</abbr> in pateros. Unfortunately i wasn't able to pass the entrance examination in <abbr title="Benigno ninoy S. Aquino Highschool">BNAHS</abbr> for <abbr title="Junior Highschool">JHS</abbr>. then after that i also graduated in <abbr title="Benigno ninoy S. Aquino Highschool">BNAHS</abbr> during Senior highschool because the school provides plenty strand for senior high.

<br>

<h2> My Digital Arts </h2>

<br>
<p> Lets talk about my favorite topic which is my hobby. the first hobby is drawing digitally.
</p>

<br>
<p> I started drawing during my elementary days when drawing from my imagination is limitless. Instead of playing with other classmates i often find myself distracted in sketching using a paper on the back of my notebooks or pad paper and any writing tools such as pen or ballpen to improve my arts skills every day. I started Digital arts when i discovered microsoft paint in our old windows 7 pc way back during my highschool days. During that time i always draw inside the software save many artworks and the rest is history untill i started drawing in a proper pen tablet connected to my mobile and personal computer. <br> The Digital drawing below shows my artwork examples during quarantine in 2020

<h2> My Animation Example </h2>

<br>
<p> My next hobby is still drawing but making it move or in short animation. Through multiple frames i was able to move a unmoveable drawing. During my childhood that fasinates me a lot while watching anime or older cartoon animator and animations. It made me reallize that not only i could draw endlessly but i could also make it move or perform any specific task.
